### CSI vs FlexVolumes

FlexVolumes are an older spec, since k8s 1.2, and will be supported in the future.  Requires root access to install on each node and assumes OS-based tools are installed. "The Storage SIG suggests implementing a CSI driver if possible"

### CSI design summary

Kubernetes will introduce a new in-tree volume plugin called CSI.

This plugin, in kubelet, will make volume mount and unmount rpcs to a unix domain socket on the host machine. The driver component responds to these requests in a specialized way. (https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface.md#kubelet-to-csi-driver-communication)


Lifecycle management of volume is done by the controller-manager (https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface.md#master-to-csi-driver-communication) and communication is mediated through the api-server, which requires that the external component watch the k8s api for changes. The design document suggests a sidecar “Kubernetes to CSI” proxy.

The concern here is that
  - communication to the diver is done through a local unix domain socket
  - the driver is untrusted and cannot be allowed to run on the master node
  - the controller manager runs on the master node
  - the driver doesn't have any kubernetes-awareness, doesn't have k8s client code or how to watch the api serer

This section: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface.md#recommended-mechanism-for-deploying-csi-drivers-on-kubernetes
shows the recommended deployment which puts the driver in a container inside a pod, sharing it with a k8s-aware container, with communication between those two via a unix domain socket "in the pod"

### Mounting

Mounting a filesystem is an os task, not cloud provider.

DO, GCE create a mounter type
 *   https://github.com/digitalocean/csi-digitalocean/blob/master/driver/mounter.go
 *   https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver/blob/master/pkg/mount-manager/mounter.go
VSphere calls out to a separate library
 *   https://github.com/akutz/gofsutil
why not use [sys](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix#Mount)? Well, it seems we need to exec out in order to call mkfs anyway

  * https://github.com/thecodeteam/csi-vsphere/blob/master/service/node.go


on our coreos installs,
 *   iscsid
 *   multipathd
are present but not running
